# IrisClassificationModel

The purpose of this model is to classify a given iris plant based on its sepal length and width and petal length and width.
There are three classes of iris - Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica and Iris-setosa encoded in the model as 0, 1, 2 respectively.

Process of Creation of the Model -

1. Extracting the data from 'https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data'
2. Checking for missing values.
3. Splitting the data into training and testing data.
4. Training the model with the training data.
5. Predicting the labels of the testing data.
6. Comparing the predicted labels with the true labels through the use of confusion matrix.
7. Plotting the histograms of the features of the model.
8. Finding the accuracy of the model with the training and testing data.
